## General note

Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the data protection regulations of the Swiss Confederation (Data Protection Act, DPA), every person is entitled to the protection of his or her privacy and security against the misuse of his or her data. The operators of these pages take the protection of your data very seriously. We treat your data confidentially and according to the legal data protection regulations as well as this privacy policy.

In cooperation with our hosting providers, we make every effort to protect the databases as well as possible against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or forgery.

We want to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g., communication by email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.

By using this website, you agree to the collection, processing, and use of data in accordance with the following description. This website can be visited without registration. Data such as pages called up or the name of the file called up, date, and time are stored on the server for statistical purposes without these data being directly related to your person. Personal data, in particular name, address, or email address, are collected voluntarily as far as possible. The data will not be passed on to third parties without your consent.

## Privacy policy for cookies

This website uses cookies. These are small text files that make it possible to store specific information relating to the user on the user's device while he or she is using the website. Cookies make it possible, in particular, to determine the frequency of use and the number of users of the pages, to analyze the behavior of page use, but also to make our offer more customer-friendly. Cookies remain stored at the end of a browser session and can be called up again when the site is revisited. If you do not wish this to happen, you should set your browser to refuse to accept cookies.

A general objection to the use of cookies used for online marketing purposes can be declared for a large number of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the US site http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU site http://www.youronlinechoices.com/. Furthermore, the storage of cookies can be achieved by deactivating them in the browser settings. Please note that not all functions of this online offer can be used then.

## Privacy policy for SSL/TLS encryption

This website uses SSL/TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as requests that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.

If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

## Privacy policy for server log files

The provider of this website automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:

- Browser type and browser version
- Operating system used
- Referrer URL
- Host name of the accessing computer
- Time of the server request

These data cannot be assigned to specific persons. A consolidation of this data with other data sources is not carried out. We reserve the right to subsequently check this data if we become aware of concrete indications of illegal use.

## Privacy policy for the use of Google Web Fonts

This website uses so-called web fonts, which are provided by Google, for the uniform display of fonts. When you call up a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into its browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly. If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font from your computer will be used.

More information about Google Web Fonts can be found at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and in the Google Privacy Policy: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.

## Amazon Affiliate Program

We are entitled based on our legitimate interests within the meaning of Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. f. DSGVO, participants in the Amazon EU partner program, which was designed to provide a medium for websites, by means of which advertising costs can be earned by placing advertisements and links to Amazon (affiliate system). As an Amazon partner, we earn on qualified purchases.

Amazon uses cookies to trace the origin of orders. Among other things, Amazon can recognize that you clicked on the partner link on our website and then, if necessary, purchased a product from Amazon.

For more information about Amazon's use of data and how to opt-out, please refer to the company's privacy policy at the link: https://www.amazon.de/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909010.

Amazon and the Amazon logo are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or one of its affiliated or associated companies.

## Note regarding data transfers to the USA (United States of America)

For the sake of completeness, we would like to point out that users based in Switzerland are subject to monitoring measures by US authorities, which generally allow the storage of all personal data from Switzerland - which has been transferred to the USA.

This is done without differentiation, restriction or exception based on the objectives pursued and without an objective criterion that would make it possible to limit the access of the US authorities to the data and their subsequent use to particular, strictly limited purposes that could justify both access to the data and interference associated with its use.

We also draw your attention to the fact that there are no legal remedies available in the USA for data subjects from Switzerland that would allow them to gain access to the data concerning them and to obtain its correction or deletion, or that there is no adequate judicial protection against general access rights of US authorities. We explicitly draw the attention of the person concerned to this legal and factual situation to make an appropriately informed decision to consent to the use of his or her data.

Users residing in a member state of the EU are advised that the USA does not have a sufficient level of data protection from the perspective of the European Union.

## Copyrights

The copyright and all other rights to content, images, photos, or other files on the website belong exclusively to the operator of this website or the specifically named rights holders. For the reproduction of all files, the written consent of the copyright holder must be obtained in advance.

Anyone who commits a copyright infringement without the consent of the respective copyright holder may be liable to prosecution and, if necessary, to damages.

## Changes

We may change this privacy policy at any time without notice. The current version published on our website applies. If the data protection declaration is part of an agreement with you, we will inform you of the change by e-mail or other suitable means in the event of an update.

## Questions to the data protection officer

If you have any questions about privacy, please write us an e-mail or contact directly the responsible person in our organization listed at the beginning of this privacy statement.
